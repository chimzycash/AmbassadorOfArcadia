Ambassador of Arcadia is an educational game aimed at children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

The game is a project developed by the Federal University of Ceará - Campus Quixadá in partnership with the psychology department of the UFC.

The game aims to assist in the treatment and follow-up of children with autism.

In this way, the game has activities that train social skills, enabling these children to understand in a playful way about social interactions.
